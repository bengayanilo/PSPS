HOW DO YOU COPE?

We have different ways of coping to our daily stresses. Some uses positive but others adopt destructive or faulty coping. We listed here some mature or helpful coping styles. Although, not all will fit your personality or present situation. In reality, some do yoga, solve their problems and prioritize, spend time with friends in the beach, seek support and appreciation from others, rest and communion with nature, take one step at a time, and meditate. Others help or do random act of kindness, laugh and being optimistic, talk it out with others, walk or jog, pray, and paint or other artistic expressions. While for some they are more comfortable going for massage, being active, play, dance, hike, travel or simply gardening. So, what is your unique way of busting stress?
